# Flow7 - AI Agent Workspace Platform

> *"Hire AI employees that work across all your existing tools, so you can focus on what humans do best."*

**Flow7** is an AI agent platform that creates autonomous "digital employees" who work 24/7 across your existing tools. Instead of complex automation rules, users describe what they want in plain English, and intelligent agents figure out how to coordinate tasks across Slack, GitHub, Gmail, calendars, project management tools, and more.

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

Modern knowledge workers are drowning in app switching and manual workflow coordination:
- Average employee uses **11+ apps daily**
- **40% of time** spent on repetitive tasks
- Manual data copying between systems
- Constant context switching between tools
- **$322 billion annually** lost to digital burnout

## üí° Our Solution

**Natural Language Agent Creation**: Users describe workflows in plain English, and Flow7 creates intelligent agents that execute them autonomously.

```
User: "Monitor our #support channel and create Jira tickets for any message with 'bug' that gets 2+ angry reactions"

Flow7: ‚úÖ Agent created - monitoring #support 24/7
       ‚úÖ Will create Jira tickets when conditions are met
       ‚úÖ Running in background, even when you're offline
```

## üöÄ Key Features
